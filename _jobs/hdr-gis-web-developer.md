description: GIS Developer at HDR in Lexington
---

HDR in Lexington, KY is looking for a GIS Developer to join our team developing web and mobile applications, most often with a spatial component. Duties include working in a professional environment with a multi-disciplinary engineering and environmental sciences consulting firm. The ability to effectively communicate and collaborate with individuals from a wide variety of backgrounds, both technical and non-technical, is required. Ideal candidates will have an understanding of GIS and familiarity with Esri software and Esri API’s, but a strong desire to learn and a passion for web and/or mobile development will also be important.

Our web development involves primarily ASP.NET MVC and Esri’s JavaScript API. Our mobile applications, primarily for data collection on iPads, require experience with iOS development using Objective-C. Android development is a plus.

We are interested in someone who is passionate, self-motivated, and has a strong desire to research, learn, and grow as a developer; someone who can appropriately apply technology to solve problems and build solutions for our clients.
