short_description: Teach programming classes

An ideal candidate for the lead instructor role would be first an educator, and second a programmer. The traits of empathy, patience, and leadership are critical in addition to the breadth of technical aptitude that our students require. The ability to explain complex concepts in a simple manner is just as important for our adult learners as it is for our K-12 learners. With a breadth of new languages, frameworks, and platforms arriving on the scene each year, we're less concerned with the code you've already written than your ability to learn whatever our students need you to learn (and help them learn) next.

- 2+ years of teaching / tutoring experience (any level)
- Experience with some combination of: iOS (Obj-C, Swift), Android, Unity, Java, C#, HTML/CSS, Javascript/jQuery, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Python
- Experience managing teams
- Active GitHub, Stack Overflow, Coach.me profiles are a plus
- Deployed software projects (mobile apps, web apps, video games) a plus
