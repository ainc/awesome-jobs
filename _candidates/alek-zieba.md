</h2>
<p><p>During my mentorship at the University of Kentucky, my mentor (Derek Fox) and I were assigned with building the mobile applications for NCUR (the National Conference on Undergraduate Research) 2014. I focused on the iOS application while my mentor focused on the Android application. Unfortunately, the iOS version is not on the store due to legalities, but the Android version is linked here.</p></p>
